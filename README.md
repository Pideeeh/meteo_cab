# meteo_cab


## Set up:
Place this repository as a subproject of the scivis repository.

Add ```add_subdirectory(meteo_cab)``` to the CmakeLists of the parent directory of this 
(just to have full build support)

Place our dataset at ```./data```

Check if build works -> Should show the same thing as prog03_volren
